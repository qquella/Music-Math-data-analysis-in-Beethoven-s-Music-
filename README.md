# Math & Music: Topological Data Analysis of Harmonic Structure in Beethoven.

We ask: how do the chords in Beethoven’s Symphony relate over time? Each chord is represented as a point in a geometric space where “distance” measures how many and how far voices would need to move to get from one chord to another. This lets harmony become a shape we can study.

Using tools from Topological Data Analysis (TDA), we apply the Mapper to build a network that sketches the landscape of the data: regions group similar chords, and bridges show smooth voice-leading paths. Persistent homology looks across many “zoom levels” and records features that persist—like connected regions and loops—so we can separate stable musical structure from noise.

We find clear harmonic neighborhoods (tonal areas), predictable corridors used for modulation, and recurrent loops linked to cadential patterns and thematic returns. Pivot chords appear as hubs connecting regions.

This project shows how Topology captures large-scale harmonic design. The approach is robust to performance choices, complements traditional analysis of music theory, and points to future comparisons across works and styles.
